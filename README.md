# A web tool for nurse scheduling.
This is a free web tool for manual nurse scheduling. I created this to simplify tasks for my mom who is a head-nurse at a hospital. 

Use the tool at [VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io/NurseScheduler](https://VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io/NurseScheduler)

## Instructions
- Allocate nurses to different wards and shifts in the hospital for the week. 
- Save and load CSV files from your progress.
- All else supposed to be self-explanatory.
