# Nurse Scheduler
This is a web interface for manual nurse scheduling. This does not solve the nurse-scheduling problem in computer science. It was created to simplify tasks for my mother who is a head nurse at a hospital. 


Use the tool at [VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io/NurseScheduler](https://VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io/NurseScheduler)

## Getting Started 
- This is a tool to allocate nurses to different hospital wards.  
- To start using, go to HOSPITAL VIEW. 
## Instructions:
