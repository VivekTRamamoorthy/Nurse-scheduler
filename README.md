# Free web tool for nurse scheduling.
This is a free web tool for manual nurse scheduling. I created this to simplify tasks for my mom who is a head-nurse at a hospital. 

Use the tool at [VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io/Nurse-sheduler](VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io/Nurse-sheduler)

## Instructions
Add nurses in nurse view
Add wards in ward view
Assign nurses to ward by dragging and dropping each nurse to a ward
